# Global Guidelines for Claude

## GitHub PR Comments

Never create GitHub PR comments to explain what you do on PRs. You can explain your changes in commit messages instead.

## Pull Request Messages

When creating pull requests:

1. Keep the PR description short and straight to the point
2. Focus on what the PR aims to achieve
3. If the approach is not trivial, briefly explain how it was done
4. Mention any tradeoffs taken in the implementation
5. Write for quick readability - a human should be able to understand it quickly
6. Never include mentions of "built by claude", "generated by claude", or similar attributions

## Commit Messages

When creating commit messages:

1. Keep them short and straight to the point
2. Follow the same guidelines as PR messages - focus on what and why
3. Never include "Co-Authored-By: Claude" or similar attributions
4. Use present tense and imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature")
5. Be specific about what was changed
